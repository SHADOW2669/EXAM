**Answer any one question in not more than 500 words.**

**18. Explain the Rani Abbakka's heroic fight against Portuguese.**

**Answer:**
Rani Abbakka Chowta was the queen of Ullal, a small principality in coastal Karnataka, India, during the 16th century. She is celebrated for her fierce resistance against the Portuguese, who were attempting to expand their colonial influence and control trade routes along the Malabar Coast. Her reign, particularly from 1570 to 1590, was marked by relentless battles against the technologically superior Portuguese forces.

The Portuguese, having established themselves in Goa and other coastal towns, sought to monopolize the lucrative spice trade, which was a vital part of Ullal's economy. They frequently demanded tribute and sought to impose their authority over local rulers. Rani Abbakka, however, refused to submit. Unlike many other rulers who succumbed to Portuguese pressure, she was determined to protect her sovereignty and her people's independence.

Her strategy was characterized by guerrilla warfare tactics, utilizing the dense local terrain and her knowledge of the coastline to her advantage. She formed alliances with other local rulers, including the Zamorin of Calicut and the Bidnur rulers, understanding the need for a united front against the common enemy. Her forces consisted of diverse groups, including Mappilas, Jains, and Hindus, reflecting the composite culture of her kingdom.

Rani Abbakka's most notable encounters with the Portuguese include the battles of 1557, 1568, and 1594. In 1568, the Portuguese General Jo√£o Peixoto launched a major assault on Ullal. Despite initial Portuguese gains and the capture of her palace, Rani Abbakka managed to escape and counter-attack the Portuguese camp that same night. She inflicted heavy casualties on them, killing Peixoto and forcing the remaining Portuguese forces to retreat to their ships. This victory was a significant morale booster for the local resistance.

Her tenacity frustrated the Portuguese, who launched multiple expeditions against her, often underestimating her resolve and military prowess. She was known for leading her troops from the front, even into battle, an unusual feat for a queen of her time. Her defiance continued even when her own estranged husband, a former ally, conspired with the Portuguese against her. She was eventually captured, but even in captivity, she continued to resist and reportedly died fighting.

Rani Abbakka's legacy is that of a symbol of courage, independence, and resistance against colonial oppression. Her story highlights the early struggles against European imperial powers in India and her unwavering commitment to protecting her homeland and its people. She remains an inspiring figure in Indian history, particularly in Karnataka, where she is celebrated as "Abbakka Veera Rani" (Brave Queen Abbakka). Her struggle serves as a reminder of the diverse and spirited resistance movements that predated the larger freedom struggle against British rule.

**19. Write any ten features of the Indian Constitution. Explain.**

**Answer:**
The Indian Constitution is a unique and comprehensive document, drawing inspiration from various constitutions worldwide while being tailored to India's specific socio-political context. Here are ten salient features:

1.  **Longest Written Constitution:** It is the longest written constitution in the world, containing 395 articles (originally), 12 schedules, and numerous amendments. Its extensive nature is due to the vastness of the country, its diversity, the detailed provisions for both the center and states, and the inclusion of fundamental rights and directive principles.

2.  **Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility:** The Indian Constitution is neither purely rigid nor purely flexible. Some provisions can be amended by a simple majority in Parliament, others by a special majority, and a few require a special majority plus ratification by half of the state legislatures. This ensures both stability and adaptability.

3.  **Parliamentary Form of Government:** India has adopted the British parliamentary system, where the executive is responsible to the legislature. The President is the nominal head, while the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are the real executive. This system emphasizes cooperation and coordination between the legislative and executive organs.

4.  **Federal System with Unitary Bias:** India's constitution establishes a federal system with a strong central government. While it features federal characteristics like two governments, division of powers, a written constitution, and an independent judiciary, it also exhibits unitary features such as a strong center, single citizenship, an integrated judiciary, and emergency provisions.

5.  **Fundamental Rights:** Part III of the Constitution guarantees six fundamental rights to all citizens, including the right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, and the right to constitutional remedies. These rights are justiciable, meaning citizens can approach the courts for their enforcement.

6.  **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):** Inspired by the Irish Constitution, these principles (in Part IV) are fundamental in the governance of the country. They are non-justiciable but serve as guidelines for the state to formulate laws and policies for establishing a welfare state, aiming for social and economic justice.

7.  **Secular State:** The Indian Constitution establishes India as a secular state, meaning it does not uphold any religion as the official state religion. It guarantees equal respect and protection to all religions, allowing individuals the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate any religion.

8.  **Independent Judiciary:** The Constitution ensures an independent and impartial judiciary to protect the supremacy of the Constitution and the fundamental rights of citizens. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial body, acting as the guardian of the Constitution and having the power of judicial review.

9.  **Single Citizenship:** Despite its federal structure, India provides for single citizenship, meaning all Indians are citizens of India, not of individual states. This promotes unity and integrity across the country and prevents discrimination based on state domicile.

10. **Universal Adult Franchise:** The Constitution grants the right to vote to every citizen above the age of 18, without any discrimination based on caste, creed, sex, religion, or economic status. This ensures broad participation in the democratic process and reflects the principle of "one person, one vote."

**Answer any one question in not more than 800 words.**

**20. Describe the Fundamental Rights of the Indian Citizen.**

**Answer:**
The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III (Articles 12-35) of the Indian Constitution. These rights are considered essential for the moral, intellectual, and spiritual development of individuals and are often referred to as the "Magna Carta of India." They are justiciable, meaning they are enforceable by the courts, and any law or executive action that violates these rights can be declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court or High Courts. Originally, there were seven fundamental rights, but the Right to Property was removed as a fundamental right by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 and made a legal right under Article 300-A. Currently, there are six categories of Fundamental Rights:

1.  **Right to Equality (Articles 14-18):**
    * **Article 14: Equality Before Law and Equal Protection of Laws:** This article ensures that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the laws. It implies that no person is above the law, and all are subject to the same laws and legal procedures.
    * **Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination on Grounds of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex or Place of Birth:** This prohibits the state from discriminating against any citizen on these grounds. It also allows the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes, and for women and children.
    * **Article 16: Equality of Opportunity in Matters of Public Employment:** Guarantees equal opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the state. It prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence, or any of them. However, the state can make provisions for reservations for backward classes.
    * **Article 17: Abolition of Untouchability:** This article abolishes "Untouchability" and forbids its practice in any form. It is a significant step towards eradicating social discrimination and ensuring dignity for all.
    * **Article 18: Abolition of Titles:** Prohibits the state from conferring titles (except military or academic distinctions). It also restricts Indian citizens from accepting titles from any foreign state.

2.  **Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22):**
    * **Article 19: Protection of Six Rights Regarding Freedom:** This is a cornerstone of individual liberty and guarantees six freedoms:
        * Freedom of speech and expression.
        * Freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms.
        * Freedom to form associations or unions or co-operative societies.
        * Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India.
        * Freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India.
        * Freedom to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business.
        * These freedoms are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state in the interest of sovereignty, integrity, security of India, public order, morality, etc.
    * **Article 20: Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences:** Provides protection against arbitrary and excessive punishment to an accused person. It includes: no ex-post-facto law (retrospective criminal legislation), no double jeopardy (punished more than once for the same offense), and no self-incrimination (forced testimony against oneself).
    * **Article 21: Protection of Life and Personal Liberty:** Declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. The Supreme Court has given a broad interpretation to this article, including the right to live with human dignity, right to livelihood, right to privacy, right to health, right to education (after Article 21A), etc.
    * **Article 21A: Right to Education:** Inserted by the 86th Amendment Act of 2002, this article makes elementary education a fundamental right for children between 6 to 14 years of age.
    * **Article 22: Protection Against Arrest and Detention in Certain Cases:** Provides safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. It mandates informing the arrested person of the grounds of arrest, the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner, and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours (excluding journey time).

3.  **Right Against Exploitation (Articles 23-24):**
    * **Article 23: Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour:** Prohibits human trafficking (selling and buying of human beings), "begar" (forced labour without remuneration), and other similar forms of forced labour.
    * **Article 24: Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories, etc.:** Prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory, mine, or other hazardous employment.

    * **Article 26: Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs:** Grants every religious denomination the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, manage its own affairs in matters of religion, own and acquire movable and immovable property, and administer such property in accordance with law.
    * **Article 27: Freedom as to Payment of Taxes for Promotion of any Particular Religion:** Prohibits the state from compelling any person to pay any taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.
    * **Article 28: Freedom as to Attendance at Religious Instruction or Religious Worship in Certain Educational Institutions:** Prohibits religious instruction in any educational institution wholly maintained out of state funds. In other institutions, it regulates religious instruction based on whether they are recognized by the state or receive aid from state funds.

5.  **Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29-30):**
    * **Article 29: Protection of Interests of Minorities:** Protects the interests of any section of citizens residing in India having a distinct language, script, or culture of its own. It grants them the right to conserve the same and prohibits discrimination in admission to educational institutions maintained or aided by the state.
    * **Article 30: Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational Institutions:** Grants all religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. The state shall not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority.

6.  **Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32):**
    * **Article 32: Remedies for Enforcement of Rights Conferred by this Part:** This is considered the "heart and soul" of the Constitution by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It provides the right to move the Supreme Court directly for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court (and High Courts under Article 226) can issue various writs:
        * **Habeas Corpus:** To produce a person who has been illegally detained.
        * **Mandamus:** To command a public official to perform his duty.
        * **Prohibition:** To prohibit a lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction.
        * **Certiorari:** To quash the order of a lower court or tribunal.
        * **Quo Warranto:** To inquire into the legality of a person's claim to a public office.
    * This right makes the Fundamental Rights enforceable and acts as a safeguard against their violation.

In essence, the Fundamental Rights are crucial for the establishment of a just and equitable society in India. They aim to protect individual liberties, promote social equality, and ensure that the state operates within constitutional limits, thereby fostering a democratic and inclusive environment for all citizens.

**21. Analyse the jurisdictions of Supreme Court.**

**Answer:**
The Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial authority in the country, established under Part V, Chapter IV of the Constitution of India. It acts as the guardian of the Constitution and the ultimate interpreter of its provisions. Its vast and extensive powers are categorized into several jurisdictions, ensuring its pivotal role in the Indian legal system.

**1. Original Jurisdiction (Article 131):**
This jurisdiction refers to cases that can be directly initiated in the Supreme Court, without going through any lower court. It primarily deals with disputes involving:
    * **Between the Centre and one or more States:** For example, a dispute between the Government of India and the Government of Karnataka.
    * **Between the Centre and any State(s) on one side and one or more other States on the other side:** For instance, a dispute between the Government of India and Uttar Pradesh on one side and Bihar on the other.
    * **Between two or more States:** Such as a dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over river water sharing.
This exclusive jurisdiction ensures that inter-state and center-state disputes are resolved by the highest court, maintaining the federal balance and preventing political interference.

**2. Writ Jurisdiction (Article 32):**
The Supreme Court is empowered to issue various writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. This is also part of its original jurisdiction, as an aggrieved person can directly approach the Supreme Court for the violation of their fundamental rights. The five types of writs are:
    * **Habeas Corpus:** To secure the release of a person unlawfully detained.
    * **Mandamus:** To command a public authority to perform its official duty.
    * **Prohibition:** To prevent a lower court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction.
    * **Certiorari:** To quash the order of a lower court or tribunal that has acted beyond its jurisdiction or committed an error of law.
    * **Quo Warranto:** To inquire into the legality of a person's claim to a public office.
This jurisdiction is a crucial safeguard for the fundamental rights of citizens, making the Supreme Court the protector and guarantor of these rights.

**3. Appellate Jurisdiction (Articles 132, 133, 134, 136):**
The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in India, hearing appeals against judgments of High Courts and other tribunals. Its appellate jurisdiction can be categorized into:
    * **Appeals in Constitutional Matters (Article 132):** An appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree, or final order of a High Court if the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.
    * **Appeals in Civil Matters (Article 133):** An appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree, or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court if the High Court certifies that a substantial question of law of general importance is involved and that the High Court thinks the question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.
    * **Appeals in Criminal Matters (Article 134):** An appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any judgment, final order, or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in certain specific cases, such as when the High Court has reversed an order of acquittal and sentenced the accused to death, or withdrawn a case from a lower court for trial and convicted the accused to death.
    * **Appeal by Special Leave (Article 136):** This is a discretionary power of the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. This power allows the Supreme Court to intervene in cases where there has been a gross miscarriage of justice or an important question of law needs to be settled.

**4. Advisory Jurisdiction (Article 143):**
Under Article 143, the President of India can seek the opinion of the Supreme Court on two categories of matters:
    * **On any question of law or fact of public importance:** The Supreme Court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon. The President is not bound by this opinion.
    * **On any dispute arising out of any pre-constitution treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, Sanad or other similar instrument:** In this case, the Supreme Court is bound to give its opinion to the President.
This jurisdiction allows the President to obtain authoritative legal advice on complex constitutional or public matters, contributing to good governance, though the advice is not binding.

**5. Review Jurisdiction (Article 137):**
The Supreme Court has the power to review its own judgments or orders. This is a crucial power that allows the Court to correct any mistakes or errors that may have crept into its decisions. This power ensures the finality and correctness of its pronouncements.

**6. Court of Record (Article 129):**
The Supreme Court is a "Court of Record," meaning:
    * Its proceedings and judgments are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony.
    * It has the power to punish for contempt of itself. This power is essential to maintain its dignity, authority, and the sanctity of judicial processes.

**7. Power of Judicial Review (Articles 13, 32, 131, 136, 226):**
This is perhaps the most significant power of the Supreme Court. It refers to the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and State governments. If they are found to be in violation of the Constitution, they can be declared null and void by the Supreme Court. This power ensures the supremacy of the Constitution and acts as a check on the powers of the legislature and executive.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India, with its wide-ranging jurisdictions, plays a pivotal role in upholding the Constitution, protecting the fundamental rights of citizens, maintaining the federal balance, and ensuring justice. Its position as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and the highest court of appeal makes it a cornerstone of India's democratic framework.
