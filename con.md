**SECTION - A**

**Note: Answer any five of the following questions. Restrict your answer to four sentences each.**

1.  **What is "Judicial Review"?**
    Judicial review is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and State governments. If a law or order is found to violate the Constitution, it can be declared null and void by the Supreme Court or High Courts. This power serves as a crucial check on the legislative and executive branches, ensuring that they operate within the bounds of the Constitution. It is a fundamental aspect of the Indian democratic system, safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution and protecting the rights of citizens.

2.  **Why India is known as 'Sovereign State'?**
    India is known as a 'Sovereign State' because it is an independent country not subject to the control of any external power or authority. It has the complete freedom to conduct its own affairs, both internal and external, without any interference. This means India can formulate its own policies, make its own laws, and engage in international relations based on its own interests and decisions. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution explicitly states that India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, affirming its independent status.

3.  **What is 'Constitutional Government'?**
    A 'Constitutional Government' is a government limited by the provisions of a constitution. Its powers are defined and constrained by a written or unwritten constitution, which specifies the structure of the government, the distribution of powers, and the rights of the citizens. This ensures that the government operates within a framework of law, preventing arbitrary rule and protecting individual liberties. In essence, it is a government of laws, not of men, where the constitution is the supreme law of the land.

4.  **State the three tier system of 'Panchayat Raj System' in India.**
    The three-tier system of the Panchayat Raj System in India is designed to promote grassroots democracy and decentralize power. The first tier is the **Gram Panchayat** at the village level, responsible for local administration and development. The second tier is the **Panchayat Samiti** (also known as Block Panchayat) at the block or intermediate level, which coordinates the activities of the Gram Panchayats. The third tier is the **Zila Parishad** at the district level, overseeing and planning for the entire district.

5.  **Who was the permanent Chairman of Constituent Assembly and who drafted Indian Constitution?**
    Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the permanent Chairman of the Constituent Assembly. While Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is widely regarded as the chief architect and the principal draftsman of the Indian Constitution, the drafting process involved several committees and members of the Constituent Assembly. The Drafting Committee, chaired by Dr. Ambedkar, was primarily responsible for preparing the draft Constitution.

6.  **Mention any two Fundamental Duties of Indian citizen.**
    Two Fundamental Duties of Indian citizens are:
    1.  To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem.
    2.  To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women.

**Note: Answer any six of the following. Restrict your answer to one page each.**

7.  **Write a brief note on 'Preamble'.**
    The Preamble to the Indian Constitution serves as an introductory statement, embodying the philosophy, ideals, and aspirations of the Constitution. Adopted on January 26, 1949, it declares India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic. The Preamble outlines the core objectives of the Constitution: to secure to all its citizens Justice (social, economic, and political), Liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship), Equality (of status and opportunity), and to promote Fraternity (assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation). It acts as a key to understanding the Constitution, reflecting the basic structure and fundamental values upon which the Indian political system is built. While not enforceable in a court of law, the Supreme Court has declared the Preamble to be an integral part of the Constitution and held that it can be amended, provided the 'basic structure' is not altered. It guides the interpretation of the Constitution and serves as a moral and political beacon for the nation.

8.  **What is Secularism?**
    Secularism, in the Indian context, means that the state does not officially promote any one religion as the state religion. It ensures that all religions are treated equally by the state, and every citizen has the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate any religion of their choice, or no religion at all. The Indian model of secularism, often described as 'positive secularism,' implies equal respect for all religions (Sarva Dharma Sambhava), rather than strict separation between religion and state as seen in some Western models. The state maintains a principled distance from all religions and intervenes only to ensure equality and social order, for instance, by prohibiting discrimination on religious grounds. This concept is enshrined in the Preamble and various Fundamental Rights, such as the freedom of religion (Articles 25-28), ensuring religious harmony and preventing religious domination.

9.  **What are the features of Federalism? Explain.**
    Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. Key features of federalism include:
    * **Two or More Levels of Government:** There are at least two levels of government, such as a central government and state governments, each with its own sphere of jurisdiction.
    * **Division of Powers:** The powers between different levels of government are clearly demarcated by the Constitution. In India, this is done through the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.
    * **Written Constitution:** A written constitution is essential to define and limit the powers of each level of government, preventing conflicts and ensuring stability.
    * **Supremacy of the Constitution:** The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and the powers of both the central and state governments are derived from and limited by it.
    * **Independent Judiciary:** An independent judiciary is crucial to interpret the Constitution and resolve disputes between different levels of government. It acts as the guardian of the Constitution.
    * **Dual Citizenship (in some federations):** While India has single citizenship, some federations like the USA have dual citizenship, where citizens are citizens of both the federal government and their respective states.
    * **Financial Autonomy:** Each level of government has its own sources of revenue, ensuring its financial independence to some extent.
    * **Rigid Constitution:** The fundamental provisions of the Constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government; amendments usually require the consent of both levels.

    India is often described as a 'quasi-federal' state, as it exhibits both federal and unitary features. While it has a division of powers, an independent judiciary, and a written constitution, the central government tends to have more power, especially during emergencies.

10. **Explain the legislative powers of the President of India.**
    The President of India, despite being a ceremonial head, possesses significant legislative powers. These include:
    * **Summoning and Proroguing Parliament:** The President has the power to summon and prorogue (discontinue) sessions of both Houses of Parliament. They can also dissolve the Lok Sabha.
    * **Addressing Parliament:** The President addresses both Houses of Parliament jointly at the commencement of the first session after each general election and at the commencement of the first session of each year, outlining government policies.
    * **Sending Messages:** The President can send messages to either House of Parliament regarding a pending bill or any other matter.
    * **Assent to Bills:** A bill passed by both Houses of Parliament cannot become an act without the President's assent. The President can give assent, withhold assent, or return a bill (except a Money Bill) for reconsideration.
    * **Ordinance Making Power (Article 123):** This is a crucial legislative power. When Parliament is not in session, and the President is satisfied that circumstances require immediate action, they can promulgate ordinances. These ordinances have the same force and effect as acts of Parliament but must be approved by Parliament within six weeks of its reassembly.
    * **Nominating Members:** The President nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha from persons having special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, and social service. They can also nominate two members of the Anglo-Indian community to the Lok Sabha if they are not adequately represented (though this provision has recently been discontinued).
    * **Prior Recommendation for Certain Bills:** Certain bills, such as Money Bills or bills involving expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India, require the President's prior recommendation for their introduction in Parliament.

    These powers highlight the President's role in the legislative process, even though they largely act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

11. **Discuss the brief functions of Rural Local Self Government.**
    Rural Local Self-Government, primarily embodied by the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), plays a crucial role in decentralized governance and rural development in India. Their functions are broadly categorized as mandatory and discretionary by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992, and further specified by state legislation. Key functions include:
    * **Provision of Basic Amenities:** This is a primary function, involving the provision and maintenance of public utilities such as drinking water supply, street lighting, sanitation facilities (toilets, drainage), and rural roads.
    * **Rural Development and Planning:** PRIs are responsible for preparing and implementing plans for economic development and social justice at the local level. This includes schemes related to agriculture, animal husbandry, minor irrigation, fisheries, and rural housing.
    * **Social Welfare:** They implement various social welfare programs, including those for poverty alleviation, welfare of weaker sections, women and child development, and public distribution system.
    * **Education:** Promoting primary and secondary education, maintaining schools, and ensuring enrollment are also within their purview.
    * **Health and Sanitation:** Providing basic health services, establishing primary health centers, and promoting public hygiene and sanitation.
    * **Collection of Taxes and Fees:** Panchayats have the power to levy and collect local taxes, rates, and fees, which contribute to their financial autonomy.
    * **Maintenance of Public Assets:** Responsible for the upkeep of community assets like village common lands, playgrounds, and community halls.
    * **Dispute Resolution:** In some areas, Panchayats also play a role in resolving minor local disputes.

    The aim of these functions is to empower local communities, ensure participatory decision-making, and facilitate effective delivery of public services tailored to local needs.

12. **Explain the features of electoral system in India.**
    India's electoral system is designed to ensure free, fair, and representative elections in a vast and diverse country. Key features include:
    * **Universal Adult Franchise:** Every citizen of India who is 18 years of age or above, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, gender, or economic status, has the right to vote.
    * **Single-Member Constituencies:** For elections to the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and State Legislative Assemblies, the country is divided into geographical constituencies, each electing one representative.
    * **First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) System:** This system, also known as pluralistic system, is used for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. In this system, the candidate who secures the most votes in a constituency wins, even if they don't have an absolute majority.
    * **Independent Election Commission:** The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an autonomous constitutional body responsible for supervising, directing, and controlling the preparation of electoral rolls and the conduct of all elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of President and Vice-President.
    * **Secret Ballot:** Voting is conducted through a secret ballot, ensuring that voters can cast their votes without fear or undue influence.
    * **Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT):** EVMs are widely used to record votes, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. VVPATs provide a physical record of the vote cast, allowing voters to verify their choice.
    * **Reservation of Constituencies:** To ensure representation for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), certain constituencies are reserved for them, meaning only candidates from these communities can contest from those seats.
    * **Voluntary Voting:** Voting in India is not compulsory; it is a right that citizens may choose to exercise.
    * **Code of Conduct:** The Election Commission enforces a Model Code of Conduct during elections to ensure a level playing field for all parties and candidates.

13. **Explain the significance of Right to Information Act.**
    The Right to Information (RTI) Act, enacted in 2005, is a landmark legislation in India that empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities. Its significance lies in several aspects:
    * **Promotes Transparency and Accountability:** The RTI Act makes government functioning more transparent by allowing citizens to demand information on various matters. This reduces the scope for corruption and promotes accountability of public officials.
    * **Empowers Citizens:** It transforms citizens from passive recipients to active participants in governance by giving them the power to question and scrutinize government decisions and actions.
    * **Combats Corruption:** By making official information accessible, the Act helps expose malpractices, misuse of power, and corruption within government departments, thereby acting as a deterrent.
    * **Strengthens Democracy:** It fosters an informed citizenry, which is crucial for a healthy democracy. Citizens can make more informed decisions about their representatives and government policies.
    * **Enhances Good Governance:** The fear of public scrutiny often leads to better decision-making and efficient service delivery by public authorities.
    * **Tool for Social Justice:** It enables marginalized and vulnerable sections of society to access information about welfare schemes and entitlements, ensuring that benefits reach the intended beneficiaries.
    * **Checks Arbitrary Power:** By bringing government records and processes into the public domain, the RTI Act acts as a check on arbitrary exercise of power by public authorities.

    In essence, the RTI Act is a powerful tool that has significantly enhanced transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in Indian governance.

14. **Describe the features of the Federal System in India.**
    The Indian Constitution establishes a federal system with a strong unitary bias, often described as 'quasi-federal.' Key features are:
    * **Two Levels of Government:** India has a central government (Union) and state governments, each operating in its own sphere of influence.
    * **Division of Powers:** Powers are explicitly divided between the Union and states through three lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution:
        * **Union List:** Subjects of national importance like defence, foreign affairs, currency, railways.
        * **State List:** Subjects of local and regional importance like public order, police, public health, agriculture.
        * **Concurrent List:** Subjects on which both Union and states can legislate, such as education, forests, trade unions. In case of conflict, Union law prevails.
    * **Written Constitution:** India has the longest written constitution in the world, which clearly demarcates the powers and responsibilities of both levels of government, minimizing ambiguities.
    * **Supremacy of the Constitution:** The Constitution is the supreme law, and both the Union and state governments derive their authority from it. No law can violate its provisions.
    * **Independent Judiciary:** The Supreme Court and High Courts act as interpreters and guardians of the Constitution, resolving disputes between the Union and states.
    * **Rigid and Flexible Constitution:** While certain federal provisions require a special majority and ratification by states for amendment (rigidity), other provisions can be amended by a simple majority (flexibility), reflecting a blend of features.
    * **Single Citizenship:** Unlike classical federations like the USA, India has single citizenship, meaning all citizens are citizens of India, not of individual states.
    * **Strong Centre:** The Indian federal system has a strong central government with more powers. The Union Parliament can legislate on subjects in the Concurrent List, residual powers lie with the Centre, and the Centre can intervene in state affairs during emergencies or in certain other circumstances, making it more unitary in practice.
    * **All-India Services:** Services like IAS and IPS are common to both the Union and state governments, further integrating the administration.

15. **Explain the features of 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992.**
    The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 gave constitutional status to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) or Municipalities in India, similar to how the 73rd Amendment did for Panchayats. Its key features include:
    * **Constitutional Status:** It made the provisions relating to ULBs justiciable, meaning states are constitutionally obligated to establish and empower them.
    * **Three Types of Municipalities:** The Act provides for the constitution of three types of municipalities based on the size of the population:
        * **Nagar Panchayats:** For areas in transition from rural to urban.
        * **Municipal Councils (Nagar Palikas):** For smaller urban areas.
        * **Municipal Corporations (Nagar Nigams):** For larger urban areas.
    * **Composition and Reservation of Seats:**
        * Direct elections for all members in a municipal area.
        * Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in proportion to their population.
        * Reservation of not less than one-third of the total number of seats for women, including those reserved for SCs and STs.
        * State legislatures can make provisions for reservation of seats for backward classes.
    * **Duration of Municipalities:** Fixed tenure of five years. If dissolved earlier, fresh elections must be held within six months.
    * **Powers and Functions (Twelfth Schedule):** The Act added the Twelfth Schedule to the Constitution, listing 18 functional items that can be devolved to municipalities. These include urban planning, regulation of land use, roads and bridges, water supply, public health, sanitation, fire services, slum improvement, and urban poverty alleviation.
    * **State Election Commission:** Mandates the constitution of a State Election Commission to conduct municipal elections.
    * **State Finance Commission:** Requires the constitution of a State Finance Commission every five years to review the financial position of municipalities and make recommendations for grants-in-aid from the Consolidated Fund of the state.
    * **District Planning Committee (DPC) and Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC):** Mandates the formation of DPCs to consolidate plans prepared by Panchayats and Municipalities in a district, and MPCs to prepare a draft development plan for the metropolitan area as a whole.

    This Act aimed to strengthen urban governance, promote decentralization, and ensure greater autonomy and financial stability for urban local bodies.

16. **Explain the Gandhian and Socialist, Directive Principles of State Policy.**
    The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are guidelines to the Central and State governments for framing laws and policies. Though not justiciable, they are fundamental in the governance of the country. They are broadly categorized into three types: Socialist, Gandhian, and Liberal-Intellectual.

    **Gandhian Principles:** These principles are based on the ideals and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. They represent his vision of a decentralized, self-sufficient India.
    * **Article 40:** To organize village panchayats as units of self-government. (This led to the 73rd and 74th Amendments).
    * **Article 43:** To promote cottage industries on an individual or co-operative basis in rural areas.
    * **Article 43B:** To promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control, and professional management of co-operative societies (added by 97th Amendment Act).
    * **Article 46:** To promote the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections and to protect them from social injustice and exploitation.
    * **Article 47:** To prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs which are injurious to health (prohibition).
    * **Article 48:** To prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle and to improve their breeds.

    **Socialist Principles:** These principles aim at establishing a welfare state by promoting social and economic justice. They reflect the ideology of democratic socialism.
    * **Article 38:** To secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people, minimizing inequalities in income, status, facilities, and opportunities.
    * **Article 39:** To secure:
        * Adequate means of livelihood for all citizens.
        * Equitable distribution of material resources for the common good.
        * Prevention of concentration of wealth and means of production.
        * Equal pay for equal work for both men and women.
        * Protection of the health and strength of workers and children against forced abuse.
        * Opportunities for healthy development of children.
    * **Article 39A:** To promote equal justice and to provide free legal aid to the poor (added by 42nd Amendment Act).
    * **Article 41:** To secure the right to work, to education, and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness, and disablement.
    * **Article 42:** To make provision for just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief.
    * **Article 43:** To secure a living wage, a decent standard of life, and social and cultural opportunities for all workers.
    * **Article 47:** To raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health.

    These Directive Principles collectively aim to build a society based on justice, equality, and human dignity, guiding the state towards achieving its socio-economic objectives.

**SECTION - C**

**Note: Answer any two of the following. Restrict your answer to two pages each.**

17. **Explain the salient features of Indian Constitution.**
    The Indian Constitution, adopted on November 26, 1949, and enforced on January 26, 1950, is a unique document that has evolved to meet the aspirations of a diverse nation. Its salient features make it one of the most comprehensive and flexible constitutions in the world:

    * **Longest Written Constitution:** India's Constitution is the longest written constitution globally, comprising a Preamble, 25 Parts (originally 22), 470 Articles (originally 395), and 12 Schedules (originally 8). This voluminous nature is due to its detailed provisions for various aspects of governance, including fundamental rights, directive principles, federal structure, emergency provisions, and detailed administrative provisions.

    * **Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility:** The Indian Constitution is neither purely rigid (like the US Constitution) nor purely flexible (like the British Constitution). It strikes a balance. Some provisions can be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, others require a special majority (two-thirds majority of members present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each house), and certain federal provisions require a special majority plus ratification by at least half of the state legislatures. This ensures that the basic structure is protected while allowing for necessary adaptations.

    * **Federal System with Unitary Bias (Quasi-Federal):** While India is fundamentally a federation with a clear division of powers between the Union and states (Union List, State List, Concurrent List), an independent judiciary, and a written constitution, it exhibits strong unitary features. The Centre has overriding powers during emergencies, residual powers rest with the Centre, states are dependent on the Centre for financial assistance, and the existence of All-India Services further strengthens the Centre. This makes it more unitary in spirit during times of crisis.

    * **Parliamentary Form of Government:** India has adopted the British Westminster model of parliamentary democracy. The President is the nominal executive (de jure head), while the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are the real executive (de facto head). The executive is responsible to the legislature (Lok Sabha), and members of the Council of Ministers are drawn from the Parliament. This system ensures collective responsibility and closer coordination between the executive and legislative branches.

    * **Synthesis of Parliamentary Sovereignty and Judicial Supremacy:** The Indian system skillfully blends the British principle of parliamentary sovereignty (Parliament's supreme law-making power) and the American principle of judicial supremacy (judiciary's power of judicial review). While Parliament can make laws, the judiciary can declare them unconstitutional if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution.

    * **Integrated and Independent Judiciary:** India has a single, unified judicial system with the Supreme Court at the top, followed by High Courts, and subordinate courts. The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislature, ensuring impartial justice. This independence is secured through various provisions like security of tenure for judges, fixed service conditions, and charging their salaries to the Consolidated Fund of India. The Supreme Court is the guarantor of Fundamental Rights and the guardian of the Constitution.

    * **Fundamental Rights:** Part III of the Constitution guarantees six Fundamental Rights to all citizens, including the Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Right against Exploitation, Right to Freedom of Religion, Cultural and Educational Rights, and Right to Constitutional Remedies. These rights are justiciable, meaning citizens can approach the Supreme Court or High Courts for their enforcement.

    * **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):** Part IV of the Constitution contains DPSPs, which are fundamental in the governance of the country, though non-justiciable. They serve as guidelines for the state to establish a welfare society based on social and economic justice, promoting policies like equitable distribution of wealth, living wage, and public health.

    * **Fundamental Duties:** Introduced by the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976 (Part IVA), these duties list the moral obligations of citizens towards the nation, such as respecting the Constitution, promoting harmony, and protecting the environment.

    * **Secular State:** The Preamble declares India a "Secular Democratic Republic." This means the state has no official religion and treats all religions equally, guaranteeing freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice, and propagate any religion.

    * **Universal Adult Franchise:** Every citizen above 18 years of age has the right to vote, irrespective of caste, creed, gender, or economic status, promoting broad-based political participation.

    * **Single Citizenship:** Unlike some federations, India provides for single citizenship, meaning a person is a citizen of India and not of any particular state. This fosters national unity.

    * **Emergency Provisions:** The Constitution contains elaborate provisions for dealing with national, state, and financial emergencies (Articles 352, 356, 360), allowing the federal structure to convert into a unitary one to maintain stability and integrity.

    * **Independent Bodies:** The Constitution establishes several independent bodies like the Election Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and State Public Service Commissions, to ensure the smooth and fair functioning of the democratic system.

    These features collectively reflect the framers' vision of a democratic, sovereign, socialist, secular, and republican India, balancing the need for strong central authority with regional autonomy and safeguarding individual liberties.

18. **What are the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Indian citizens? Explain.**
    Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III (Articles 12-35) of the Indian Constitution. These are essential rights that are fundamental for the overall development of individuals and are protected by the Constitution. They are justiciable, meaning citizens can move the courts for their enforcement if violated. Originally seven, the Right to Property was removed as a Fundamental Right by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978, making it a legal right (Article 300A). Currently, there are six categories of Fundamental Rights:

    1.  **Right to Equality (Articles 14-18):**
        * **Article 14: Equality before Law and Equal Protection of Laws:** This ensures that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. It prohibits discrimination.
        * **Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination on grounds of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex or Place of Birth:** The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on these grounds. It also allows for special provisions for women, children, and socially and educationally backward classes or SCs/STs.
        * **Article 16: Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment:** Guarantees equal opportunity for all citizens in matters of employment or appointment to any office under the state. It allows for reservations for backward classes if they are not adequately represented.
        * **Article 17: Abolition of Untouchability:** Untouchability is abolished, and its practice in any form is forbidden.
        * **Article 18: Abolition of Titles:** Prohibits the state from conferring any titles (except military or academic distinctions). Citizens are also prohibited from accepting titles from foreign states.

    2.  **Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22):**
        * **Article 19: Protection of Six Rights regarding Freedom:**
            * Freedom of Speech and Expression.
            * Freedom to Assemble peaceably and without arms.
            * Freedom to Form Associations or Unions or Co-operative Societies.
            * Freedom to Move Freely throughout the territory of India.
            * Freedom to Reside and Settle in any part of the territory of India.
            * Freedom to Practice any Profession, or to carry on any Occupation, Trade or Business.
            These freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state.
        * **Article 20: Protection in respect of Conviction for Offences:** Guarantees protection against ex-post facto laws, double jeopardy, and self-incrimination.
        * **Article 21: Protection of Life and Personal Liberty:** No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. This article has been widely interpreted by the judiciary to include various aspects of human dignity, privacy, and right to live with dignity.
        * **Article 21A: Right to Education:** Ensures that the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the state may, by law, determine (added by 86th Amendment Act, 2002).
        * **Article 22: Protection against Arrest and Detention in certain cases:** Guarantees rights to a person who is arrested, including the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner, and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest.

    3.  **Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24):**
        * **Article 23: Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour:** Prohibits human trafficking, begar (forced labor), and other similar forms of forced labor.
        * **Article 24: Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories, etc.:** Prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory, mine, or other hazardous employment.

    4.  **Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25-28):**
        * **Article 25: Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and Propagation of Religion:** Guarantees all persons the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate any religion.
        * **Article 26: Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs:** Every religious denomination has the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, manage its own affairs in matters of religion, own and acquire movable and immovable property, and administer such property in accordance with law.
        * **Article 27: Freedom as to Payment of Taxes for Promotion of any particular Religion:** No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.
        * **Article 28: Freedom as to Attendance at Religious Instruction or Religious Worship in certain Educational Institutions:** Prohibits religious instruction in state-funded educational institutions and allows for voluntary attendance in institutions recognized or aided by the state.

    5.  **Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29-30):**
        * **Article 29: Protection of Interests of Minorities:** Protects the right of any section of citizens having a distinct language, script, or culture to conserve the same. It also prohibits discrimination in admission to educational institutions maintained or aided by the state.
        * **Article 30: Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational Institutions:** Grants all minorities, whether based on religion or language, the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

    6.  **Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32):**
        * **Article 32: Remedies for Enforcement of Fundamental Rights:** This is considered the most important Fundamental Right, as it guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court directly for the enforcement of other Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court can issue various writs (Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari, and Quo Warranto) to protect these rights. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar called Article 32 the "heart and soul" of the Constitution.

    These Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, health, and the security of the state. However, they form the bedrock of India's democratic system, safeguarding the liberty and dignity of its citizens.

19. **Explain the jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court.**
    The Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial authority in the country, established under Article 124 of the Constitution. It is the guardian of the Constitution and the protector of the Fundamental Rights of citizens. Its jurisdiction and powers are extensive and can be broadly categorized as follows:

    **1. Original Jurisdiction (Article 131):**
    This refers to cases that can be directly filed with the Supreme Court, without going through lower courts. Its original jurisdiction is exclusive in disputes:
    * Between the Government of India and one or more States.
    * Between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other side.
    * Between two or more States.
    This jurisdiction pertains to legal disputes involving questions of law or fact, regarding the existence or extent of a legal right.

    **2. Writ Jurisdiction (Article 32):**
    The Supreme Court has the power to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. This is a part of its original jurisdiction and is often referred to as its 'guarantee jurisdiction' because it guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. The five types of writs are:
    * **Habeas Corpus:** To produce a person who has been detained, allowing the court to examine the legality of detention.
    * **Mandamus:** A command from a superior court to a lower court or public authority to perform a public duty.
    * **Prohibition:** Issued by a superior court to prevent a lower court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction.
    * **Certiorari:** To quash an order passed by a lower court or tribunal that has exceeded its jurisdiction or committed an error of law.
    * **Quo Warranto:** To inquire into the legality of a claim by a person to a public office.

    **3. Appellate Jurisdiction (Articles 132, 133, 134, 136):**
    The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in India and hears appeals against the judgments of High Courts and other tribunals. Its appellate jurisdiction extends to:
    * **Constitutional Matters (Article 132):** Appeals involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.
    * **Civil Matters (Article 133):** Appeals in civil cases if the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance or that the High Court thinks the case ought to be decided by the Supreme Court.
    * **Criminal Matters (Article 134):** Appeals in criminal cases if the High Court has reversed an order of acquittal and sentenced the accused to death, or has withdrawn a case from a subordinate court for trial and convicted the accused, or certifies that the case is fit for appeal to the Supreme Court.
    * **Appeal by Special Leave (Article 136):** The Supreme Court has the discretionary power to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India (except military tribunals and courts martial). This is a very wide power, allowing the Supreme Court to hear appeals even when no appeal lies as a matter of right.

    **4. Advisory Jurisdiction (Article 143):**
    The President of India can seek the opinion of the Supreme Court on two types of matters:
    * On any question of law or fact of public importance.
    * On any dispute arising out of any pre-constitution treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, Sanad or other similar instrument.
    The Supreme Court's opinion in such cases is only advisory and not binding on the President.

    **5. Review Jurisdiction (Article 137):**
    The Supreme Court has the power to review its own judgments or orders. This power is crucial to correct any error that might have crept into its previous judgment and to ensure justice.

    **6. Court of Record (Article 129):**
    The Supreme Court is a court of record, meaning:
    * Its judgments, proceedings, and acts are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony.
    * It has the power to punish for contempt of itself.

    **7. Power of Judicial Review (Articles 13, 32, 131, 136, 143, 226):**
    This is one of the most significant powers. The Supreme Court has the power to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and State governments. If they are found to be violative of the Constitution, they can be declared illegal, unconstitutional, and invalid by the Supreme Court. This power acts as a check on the powers of the legislature and executive, upholding the supremacy of the Constitution.

    **8. Other Powers:**
    * **Guardian of the Constitution:** The Supreme Court is the final interpreter and guardian of the Constitution.
    * **Interpreter of Laws:** It interprets laws passed by Parliament and State Legislatures.
    * **Power to make its own rules:** Subject to any law made by Parliament, the Supreme Court can make rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court.

    The vast jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court underscore its pivotal role in the Indian democratic framework, ensuring justice, upholding the rule of law, and maintaining the balance of powers.

20. **Describe the structure, functions of the Council of Ministry and the Chief Minister.**
    In the Indian parliamentary system at the state level, the Chief Minister (CM) is the real executive head, while the Governor is the nominal executive. The Chief Minister heads the Council of Ministers, which collectively aids and advises the Governor in the exercise of their functions.

    **I. Chief Minister (CM):**

    **Appointment:** The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor. In a general election to the state legislative assembly, the leader of the party that secures a majority of seats is appointed as the Chief Minister. If no single party gets a clear majority, the Governor may use their discretion to invite the leader of the largest party or a coalition to form the government and prove majority support within a stipulated time.

    **Functions and Powers of the Chief Minister:**
    1.  **Head of Government:** The CM is the real executive head of the state government.
    2.  **Leader of the House:** The CM is the leader of the majority party in the State Legislative Assembly.
    3.  **Formation of Council of Ministers:** The Governor appoints other ministers only on the advice of the Chief Minister. The CM decides the size of the Council of Ministers and allocates portfolios among them.
    4.  **Presides over Council of Ministers:** The CM presides over the meetings of the Council of Ministers, guides their deliberations, and controls their agenda.
    5.  **Coordinator and Link:** The CM coordinates the work of various departments and acts as a link between the Council of Ministers and the Governor. All decisions of the Council of Ministers are communicated to the Governor by the CM.
    6.  **Adviser to the Governor:** The CM advises the Governor regarding the summoning and proroguing of the sessions of the state legislature and the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.
    7.  **Chief Spokesperson:** The CM is the chief spokesperson of the state government.
    8.  **Crisis Manager:** The CM plays a crucial role in managing crises and making important policy decisions for the state.
    9.  **Leadership during Elections:** The CM is often the face of the party during state elections and plays a significant role in campaigning.

    **II. Council of Ministers:**

    **Structure:**
    The Council of Ministers is a large body comprising all the ministers, irrespective of their rank. It typically consists of three categories of ministers:
    1.  **Cabinet Ministers:** These are the senior-most ministers who hold important portfolios (e.g., Finance, Home, Education, Health) and are members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet is the small, inner body within the Council of Ministers that takes all major policy decisions.
    2.  **Ministers of State:** They can either be given independent charge of departments or be attached to Cabinet Ministers to assist them.
    3.  **Deputy Ministers:** They are attached to Cabinet Ministers or Ministers of State and assist them in their administrative and parliamentary duties.

    **Appointment:** Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. A person must be a member of the state legislature to become a minister. If a non-member is appointed, they must become a member (by election or nomination) within six months.

    **Collective Responsibility (Article 164):**
    This is a cornerstone of the parliamentary system. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the State Legislative Assembly. This means:
    * All ministers stand or fall together. If a no-confidence motion is passed against the Council of Ministers in the Assembly, the entire ministry (including the CM) has to resign.
    * All ministers are bound by the decisions of the Cabinet, even if they disagree with them internally. They must publicly support Cabinet decisions.

    **Individual Responsibility:**
    Ministers also hold individual responsibility to the Governor. They hold office during the pleasure of the Governor. However, the Governor exercises this pleasure on the advice of the Chief Minister. Thus, the CM can ask a minister to resign, or advise the Governor to dismiss them.

    **Functions of the Council of Ministers:**
    1.  **Formulation of Policies:** The Council of Ministers, particularly the Cabinet, formulates all major policies of the state government.
    2.  **Legislative Functions:** Ministers introduce bills in the state legislature, explain the government's stand on various issues, and get legislation passed.
    3.  **Executive Functions:** They implement the laws passed by the legislature and administer their respective departments.
    4.  **Financial Functions:** They prepare the annual budget of the state and propose various financial measures.
    5.  **Advisory to Governor:** The Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister, aids and advises the Governor in the discharge of their functions.
    6.  **Coordination:** They ensure coordination among various departments to achieve government objectives.
    7.  **Emergency Management:** The Council plays a vital role in handling emergencies and unforeseen situations within the state.

    In essence, the Chief Minister is the pivot around whom the entire state administration revolves, and the Council of Ministers, led by the CM, is the primary decision-making body responsible for the governance of the state.
